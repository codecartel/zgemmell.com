                <p>I’m Adam Noffsinger, a Senior Product Designer at Dropbox working on Design Systems. I’ve been at Dropbox since late 2017.</p>
                <p>Before joining Dropbox, I was an early designer at Uber and worked on the consumer-facing Rides and Eats mobile apps for about 3 years. It was one heckuva wild ride.</p>
                <p>Before getting into design, I pursued creative writing (poetry, if we're being specific) and was an Account Manager at an advertising agency. Variety is the spice of life, right?</p>
                <p>I'm most passionate about mobile product, but have extensive experience across web and desktop too. I'm interested in solving problems related to transportation and mapping, fitness, gaming, music, and travel.</p>
                <p>When I'm not designing, I love getting my hands dirty in Swift and mentoring younger designers on craft skills.</p>
