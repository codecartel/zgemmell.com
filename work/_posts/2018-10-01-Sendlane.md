shippedDate: October 2018
overview:
    - As Sendlane entered a growth period and began looking for investment, it became clear that if we were going to compete with the likes of Active Campaign, we needed to modernize our core email automation feature.
    - Users were having a hard time discovering how to use the feature and it was expensive for the support team to teach them one-on-one.
    - At the same time, as a small team, we needed to stay lean and make improvements quickly.
    - Over the course of several months, I redesigned the feature and worked with the development team to launch it.
outcome:
    - Unforunately we were unable get quantitative results due to a lack of analytics tools but the customer support team was very happy with the results and our users were too.
    - The framework and associated components that were developed for this feature laid the foundation for a broader refresh of the entire platform.
tools:
    - Sketch, Vue.js, Buefy

The project was much more than a redesign of the automation feature. Rather, it created a new framework and component library that was used to redesign the entire platform.

Three core screens from the flow.

To test these changes, I built out a robust prototype utilizing real San Francisco restaurant data from our backend to bulletproof the designs.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

In this prototype, I also explored motion concepts for our new header, which introduced a top-level, pill-based navigation that surfaced when a user scrolled to the menu content.

Our decision to make the navigation top-level was a direct reaction to previous issues with navigation discoverability and our hypothesis that a clear navigation would increase conversion for longer menus.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

The navigation would automatically cycle through and highlight navigation anchors as the user scrolled, to help them understand and encourage them to interact with the new paradigm.

Introducing a new header and subpages to the menu framework also required creating guidelines for layering UI and creating depth.

Layering specs were added to the Eats UI kit, while sub page transitions were are also included in the prototype.
