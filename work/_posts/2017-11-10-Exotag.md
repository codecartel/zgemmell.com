overview:
    - Exotag is a project that I co-founded with several friends.
    - Exotag addresses the problem of blood product wastage at Stanford University Hospital. Blood wastage costs Standford approximately $350K/year.
    - We were awarded a spectrum grant to develop the solution.
    - We have since iterated through several generations of requirements and solutions finally landing on our latest prototype device.
tools:
    - Sketch, ProtoPie, Xcode, Vue.js, CSS

Detail view that shows the temperature history of the blood product.

During transportation, blood products must be maintained between 1-10 ÂºC or else they must be thrown away. Based on thermodynamic models, our device is able to anticipate when a blood product will go out of that range and alert hospital staff.

In addition to these flows, we also had to account for fraud fighting features, social login methods, and various permission requests.

A selection of screens from the mobile app.

In all, the system ended up having around 40 screens, which were then versioned into multiple languages.

All screens in the system were created from 8 base layouts that were designed to minimize on-screen information, maintain visual consistency, and make internationalization easy.

Since we opted to have more steps in our signup flow in favor of less information density, creating the illusion of speed through motion was a key design principle.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

I designed and prototyped various motion directions to make the signup and login experience feel fluid, fast, and delightful. The animation of our circular continue button matches the animation treatment for the circular shortcut buttons riders would later encounter on the home screen.
