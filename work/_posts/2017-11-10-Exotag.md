overview:
    - Exotag is a project that I co-founded with several friends.
    - The project started as a solution to the problem of blood product wastage at the Stanford University Hospital.
    - We were awarded a spectrum grant to develop the solution.
    - We have since developed several generations of solutions to the problem finally landing on our latest prototype device.
tools:
    - Sketch, ProtoPie, Xcode, Vue.js, CSS

![Main signup and login flow](../images/signup/signup-flow-1.png){: .post-image}
Signup from phone number, login from phone number, and login from email.

Calling this project “Signup” is probably an over-simplification.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Our product required that we create flows covering signup from phone number (the ideal scenario), login from phone number (also an ideal scenario), as well as login from email (a fallback for riders with new phone numbers), and signup while “reclaiming” a mobile number (if your number had been previously registered by someone else).

In addition to these flows, we also had to account for fraud fighting features, social login methods, and various permission requests.

A selection of screens from the platform.

In all, the system ended up having around 40 screens, which were then versioned into multiple languages.

All screens in the system were created from 8 base layouts that were designed to minimize on-screen information, maintain visual consistency, and make internationalization easy.

Since we opted to have more steps in our signup flow in favor of less information density, creating the illusion of speed through motion was a key design principle.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

I designed and prototyped various motion directions to make the signup and login experience feel fluid, fast, and delightful. The animation of our circular continue button matches the animation treatment for the circular shortcut buttons riders would later encounter on the home screen.
